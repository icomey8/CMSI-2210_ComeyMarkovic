Note:
- 1 file is a python solution run through the command line that can be used to answer all the questions.
- 3 files are C solutions IN PROGRESS.  To be revised and completed soon.  Will likely need to ask for assistance.

The class website said any language was acceptable for this assignment, which is why we have a python version.  Working on a C version becuase learning C is a primary goal of this class.
