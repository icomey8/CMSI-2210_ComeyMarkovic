1. What is a computer system?
    A computer system, to me, is the intricate organization of hardware and software processes and how they interact.  Like we discussed in class, it can be visualized as a set of layers, where each layer builds off of what the layer below it does.

2. What are some of the parts of a computer system?
    A computer system has a lot of parts; its hardware is made up of the CPU, the motherboard, the hard drive, and circuits and chips.  On the software side, there is the operating system, embedded software, and more.

3. What is the difference between a compiled language and an interpreted language?
    The main difference is that an interpreted language uses another program to interpret code, while with a compiled language, the machine does it directly.

4. Is C a compiled language?
    C is a compiled language because it uses a compiler to translate code into assembly code, which is then translated once more to machine code before it is executed. 

5. Who invented the C language?
    C was invented by computer scientist Dennis Ritchie in the 1970s as a successor to its previous iteration, B.
