## C-Level Problems:

1. Hex FAC3 in binary is:
```
= (1111) + (1010) + (1100) + (0011)
= 1111 1010 1100 0011
```

3. Hex FAC3 as an unsigned decimal is:
```
= 15(16^3) +  10(16^2) + 12(16^1) + 3(16^0)
= 61440 + 2560 + 192 + 3
= 64195
```
 
5. Hex FAC3 as a signed decimal is:
```
= FFFF - FAC3
= 053C + 1
= 053D
= 0(16^3) + 5(16^2) + 3(16^1) + 13(16^0)
= 1280 + 48 + 13
= -1341
```

7. Hex 0064 in binary is:
```
= 0000 + 0000 + 0110 + 0100
= 0000 0000 0110 0100
```

9. Hex 0064 as an unsigned decimal is:
```
= 0(16^3) + 0(16^2) + 6(16^1) + 4(16^0)
= 0 + 0 + 96 + 4
= 100
```

11. Hex 0064 as a signed decimal is:
```
= 100 * -1
= -100
```

13. Hex 8000 in binary is:
```
= (1000) +  (0000) +  (0000) + (0000)
= 1000 0000 0000 0000
```

15. Hex 8000 as an unsigned decimal is:
