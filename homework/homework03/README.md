## C-Level Problems:

1. Hex FAC3 in binary is:
&ensp;     = (1111) + (1010) + (1100) + (0011)
&ensp;     = 1111 1010 1100 0011

2. Hex FAC3 as an unsigned decimal is:
	  = 15(16^3) +  10(16^2) + 12(16^1) + 3(16^0)
	  = 61440 + 2560 + 192 + 3
	  = 64195
 
3. Hex FAC3 as a signed decimal is:
    = FFFF - FAC3
	  = 053C + 1
	  = 053D
	  = 0(16^3) + 5(16^2) + 3(16^1) + 13(16^0)
	  = 1280 + 48 + 13
	  = -1341

4. Hex 0064 in binary is:
	  = 0000 + 0000 + 0110 + 0100
	  = 0000 0000 0110 0100

5. Hex 0064 as an unsigned decimal is:
  	= 0(16^3) + 0(16^2) + 6(16^1) + 4(16^0)
  	= 0 + 0 + 96 + 4
  	= 100

6. Hex 0064 as a signed decimal is:
  	= 100 * -1
  	= -100
  
7. Hex 8000 in binary is:
  	= (1000) +  (0000) +  (0000) + (0000)
  	= 1000 0000 0000 0000

8. Hex 8000 as an unsigned decimal is:


9. Hex 8000 as a signed decimal is:

11. Decimal 8000 encoded in 16-bits (signed) is in hex:


12. Decimal -11 encoded in 16-bits (signed) is in hex:


13. Decimal -32717 encoded in 16-bits (signed) is in hex:


14. Binary 10111101 in hex is:


15. Binary 1011110100000001 as an unsigned decimal is:


16. Binary 1011110100000001 as a signed decimal is:


17. If we had 20-bit registers, the smallest signed decimal integer value would be:


18. If we had 20-bit registers, the largest signed decimal integer value would be:


19. The modular sum of 16-bit hex values 3511 + 4FFC is:


20. The saturated sum of 16-bit hex values 3511 + 4FFC is:


21. The 16-bit operation 0x3511 + 0x4FFC has a carry (Y or N):


22. The 16-bit operation 0x3511 + 0x4FFC has a overflows (Y or N):
