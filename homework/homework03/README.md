## C-Level Problems:

1. Hex FAC3 in binary is:
'''
= (1111) + (1010) + (1100) + (0011)
   = 1111 1010 1100 0011
'''

3. Hex FAC3 as an unsigned decimal is:
'''
= 15(16^3) +  10(16^2) + 12(16^1) + 3(16^0)
= 61440 + 2560 + 192 + 3
= 64195
'''
 
5. Hex FAC3 as a signed decimal is:
    = FFFF - FAC3
	  = 053C + 1
	  = 053D
	  = 0(16^3) + 5(16^2) + 3(16^1) + 13(16^0)
	  = 1280 + 48 + 13
	  = -1341

6. Hex 0064 in binary is:
	  = 0000 + 0000 + 0110 + 0100
	  = 0000 0000 0110 0100

7. Hex 0064 as an unsigned decimal is:
  	= 0(16^3) + 0(16^2) + 6(16^1) + 4(16^0)
  	= 0 + 0 + 96 + 4
  	= 100

8. Hex 0064 as a signed decimal is:
  	= 100 * -1
  	= -100
  
9. Hex 8000 in binary is:
  	= (1000) +  (0000) +  (0000) + (0000)
  	= 1000 0000 0000 0000
