1. What is a computer system?
    A computer system, to me, is the intricate organization of hardware and software processes and how they interact.  Like we discussed in class, it can be visualized as a set of layers, where each layer builds off of what the layer below it does.

2. What are some of the parts of a computer system?
    A computer system has a lot of parts; its hardware is made up of the CPU, the motherboard, the hard drive, and circuits and chips.  On the software side, there is the operating system, embedded software, and more.

3. What is the difference between a compiled language and an interpreted language?
    The main difference is that an interpreted language uses another program to interpret code, while with a compiled language, the machine does it directly.

4. Is C a compiled language?
    C is a compiled language because it uses a compiler to translate code into assembly code, which is then translated once more to machine code before it is executed.

5. Who invented the C language?
    C was invented by computer scientist Dennis Ritchie in the 1970s as a successor to its previous iteration, B.

6. How long has C been in use?
    C has been in use since the 1970s and especially gained popularity during the 1980s.”

7. ​​Is a compiler a translator?
    Yes, a compiler is a translator because it runs source code and translates the code into assembly language. (CMSI 2210 Week 02 Page)

8. Is an assembler a translator?
    Yes, an assembler is a translator because it runs assembly code and translates it into machine language. (CMSI 2210 Week 02 Page)

9. What is the command to list out the contents of a directory on a Mac terminal window?
    The command to list the contents of a directory on a Mac terminal window is “ls”, which is an abbreviation for “list”. 

10. What does the C function atof() do?
    The C function atof() converts a string into a floating-point number. ‘Atof’ stands for “ASCII to float” 

11. What are the bottom two layers of a computer system? Give a brief description of each.
    The bottom two layers of a computer system are the digital logic layer and the control layer. The digital logic layer is the hardware in which all computer operations are run. The control layer uses the previous layer and contains the microcode that uses the hardware. (CMSI 2210 Week 02 Page)

12. What are the three steps of the Von Neumann Architecture?
    The three steps of the Von Neumann Architecture are the central processing unit (CPU), main memory, and input/output system. We can explain the connection of these three steps by using a system “bus”. First, the data bus carries the bits that are transferred between the CPU, main memory, and the input/output systems. The CPU then uses the address bus to access the other parts of the system. The control bus allows the parts of the system to interact in different ways. Another way we can see it is when the control unit fetches the next program instruction, it is decoded, then the ALU executes the decoded instruction.(CMSI 2210 Week 02 Page)

13.) What is the purpose of an ALU?
    Von Neumann architecture can be simplified into the steps fetch, decode, and execute. The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) conducts the third and final step of this process: execute. The ALU executes integer operations, both mathematical and bit-wise. (CMSI 2210 Week 02 Page)

14.) What is a register?
    Registers are a form of memory storage units found in the central processing unit (CPU). One such register that can be found here is the program counter. Registers transfer and store information temporarily for the execution of processes by the CPU. (https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/library/computer-registers)

15.) What is one difference between Application software and System software?
    While application software is written for people and deals with human-centered concepts such as users and orders, system software is written for computers and addresses computer-centered concepts such as registers and memory. (CMSI 2210 Week 02 Page)

16.) Is the phrase cmp rdi, rsi in machine language?
    The phrase “cmp rdi, rsi” is in assembly language. While not machine language, assembly language maps machine language one-to-one. This phrase tells the computer to compare the value of the first variable, rdi, to the value of the second variable, rsi. (CMSI 2210 Week 02 Page)

17.) How many buses are included in the system bus?
    The system bus includes three buses: the data bus, the address bus, and the control bus. (CMSI 2210 Week 02 Page)

18.) What is the decimal value of 100101112?
    10010111 = 27 + 0 + 0 + 24 + 0 + 22 + 21 + 20 = 128 + 16 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 151

19.) What is the decimal value of 111111112?
    11111111 = 27 + 26 + 25 + 24 + 23 + 22 + 21 + 20 = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 255

20.) What is the largest unsigned integer value that will fit into 16 bits?
    The largest unsigned integer value that will fit into 16 bits is 11111111111111112, which is equivalent to 65535.
